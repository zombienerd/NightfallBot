Welcome to NightfallBot

A discord bot for cross-server communications.

Created with Node.js and Discord.js for the Nightfall Alliance

Work in progress.  Don't expect much, I'm an unskilled monkey slapping a typewriter.

Install node.js
Install discord.js

Copy demo-config.json to config.json - edit the guts

use node index.js to start the bot.

This code is desgined to work on 3-5 servers with 2 channels on each.  You can comment/uncomment lines necessary in crossServer.js to add/remove functionality.  The codebase is currently configured for 3 servers with 2 channels on each. Channels 1-5 are linked, Channels 6-10 are linked.  If you want different, comment/uncomment lines, and debug. You'll want to edit the serverAcronyms in crossServer.js to match your guild/org/server name or delete the text between the quotes to have it blanked.

It should be relatively easy to follow, if you have basic understanding of node.js discord.js and the like.  If not, feel free to drop a message here on github, or a DM on discord @yestergearpc  -  No promises I'll have time to answer and assist.
